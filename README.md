# reactjs-lastfm-test
A test to grab data from LastFM's API and display the most recent tracks solely using React.js

I created this so I can have some code to refer back to and understand how these concepts work.  I will be creating a React.js + LastFM + Flux(maybe?) app for displaying LastFM data in the coming weeks!

Hopefully anyone else learning React.js or LastFM's API can seek some use from this snippet.
